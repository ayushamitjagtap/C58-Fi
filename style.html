        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> I Like to play Cricket because Cricket is a sport that requires the use of a bat and ball. It is easily one of the most prevalent sports in the world. This game consists of two teams that include 11 players each. The main aim of the game is to score the highest number of runs.</p>
